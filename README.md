# U-Net for brain segmentation

U-Net implementation in PyTorch for FLAIR abnormality segmentation in brain MRI based on a deep learning segmentation algorithm used in [Association of genomic subtypes of lower-grade gliomas with shape features automatically extracted by a deep learning algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.05.002).

This repository is an all Python port of official MATLAB/Keras implementation in [brain-segmentation](https://github.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation).
Weights for trained models are provided and can be used for inference or fine-tuning on a different dataset.
If you use code or weights shared in this repository, please consider citing:

## PyTorch Hub

Loading model using PyTorch Hub: [pytorch.org/hub/mateuszbuda\_brain-segmentation-pytorch\_unet](https://pytorch.org/hub/mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet/)

```python
import torch
model = torch.hub.load('mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch', 'unet',
    in_channels=3, out_channels=1, init_features=32, pretrained=True)
```

## data

![dataset](./assets/brain-mri-lgg.png)

Dataset used for development and evaluation was made publicly available on Kaggle: [kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation).
It contains MR images from [TCIA LGG collection](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/TCGA-LGG) with segmentation masks approved by a board-certified radiologist at Duke University.

## model

A segmentation model implemented in this repository is U-Net as described in [Association of genomic subtypes of lower-grade gliomas with shape features automatically extracted by a deep learning algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.05.002) with added batch normalization.

|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 94% DSC | 91% DSC | 89% DSC |

Qualitative results for validation cases from three different institutions with DSC of 94%, 91%, and 89%.
Green outlines correspond to ground truth and red to model predictions.
Images show FLAIR modality after preprocessing. 

![dsc](./assets/dsc.png)

Distribution of DSC for 10 randomly selected validation cases.
The red vertical line corresponds to mean DSC (91%) and the green one to median DSC (92%).
Results may be biased since model selection was based on the mean DSC on these validation cases.

## inference

1. Download and extract the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation).
2. Run docker container.
3. Run `inference.py` script with specified paths to weights and images. Trained weights for input images of size 256x256 are provided in `./weights/unet.pt` file. For more options and help run: `python3 inference.py --help`.

## train

1. Download and extract the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation).
2. Run docker container.
3. Run `train.py` script. Default path to images is `./kaggle_3m`. For more options and help run: `python3 train.py --help`.

Training can be also run using Kaggle kernel shared together with the dataset: [kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch).
Due to memory limitations for Kaggle kernels, input images are of size 224x224 instead of 256x256.

Running this code on a custom dataset would likely require adjustments in `dataset.py`.
Should you need help with this, just open an issue.
